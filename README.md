Supervised Machine Learning for Non-Linear Dynamical Systems

## Abstract
#### The aim of this project is to provide a unified framework for identifying the underlying dynamics of observations solely from data, and to classify new observations based upon the learned dynamics. Koopman[1] provides us with the insight that a large range of non-linear autonomous systems can be represented as a linear dynamical system in an infinite-dimensional space. The result is promising; it is not merely a linear approximation, but rather an exact linearization of various non-linear dynamics. Thus, theoretically, there exists a transformation $\phi$ that renders the non-linear dynamics linear, along with a linear operator $M$ that governs the dynamics of the transformed non-linear system. Our interpretation of the result from Koopman[1] is that if we can identify a pair $(\phi, M)$ which could be regarded as key characteristics of a certain dynamics, we can perform supervised classification of new observations.
